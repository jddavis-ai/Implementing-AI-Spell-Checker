# Implementing-AI-Spell-Checker

Here's some fun instructions for implementing an CIM spell checker (this is a variation of a transformers model).

# CIM-Base (12-layer) for cim-misspelling

This documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to run the CIM-Base (12-layer) model for cim-misspelling. The code is available in the [dalgu90/cim-misspelling](https://github.com/dalgu90/cim-misspelling) repository.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Python installed
- Git installed (if you want to clone the repository)
- An internet connection (to install dependencies)
- A Windows laptop or access to Google Colab

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you don't already have the code, you can clone the GitHub repository by running the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dalgu90/cim-misspelling
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries by running:

```shell
pip install torch transformers
```

## Step 3: Load the Pretrained Model

Now, you need to load the pretrained CIM-Base model and tokenizer:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "dalgu90/CIM-Base"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

## Step 4: Perform Inference

To correct misspelled text, you can use the `correct_misspelling` function:

```python
def correct_misspelling(input_text):
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
    corrected = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1, no_repeat_ngram_size=2, top_k=50, top_p=0.95, temperature=0.7)
    corrected_text = tokenizer.decode(corrected[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return corrected_text
```

## Step 5: Example Inference

You can perform inference using the `correct_misspelling` function like this:

```python
input_text = "Here is an example sentence with miztake."
corrected_text = correct_misspelling(input_text)
print("Original Text:", input_text)
print("Corrected Text:", corrected_text)
```

This will demonstrate the correction of misspelled text.
